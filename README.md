 Testing Perfomance of Godot4
 Here are some examples to demonstrate perfomance of Godot4
 I'm using Godot4.2.beta1.mono.official
 
# Testing Scenario
First Test is a 2D Multimesh Test both written in GDScript and C#.
I can spawn 41000 bullets with GDScript and 125000 bullets with C# before the fps drops under 60fps.
(My testing machine : Ryzen 7 5800X,32gRam,Radeon 6600XT)

# Improvements
If anyone has tips and tricks to increase performance even further, please let me know :)
